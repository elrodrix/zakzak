## ConsoleAsyncExporter

The `ConsoleAsyncExporter` outputs live benchmark results in table.
Whenever a benchmark is finished, the results are printed.
This makes formatting of the table difficult, which is why the table of this exporter takes up more space than the table of `ConsoleExporter`.

## ConsoleExporter

The `ConsoleExporter` prints detailled results of all the benchmarks in a table.
Only prints them, after all are finished.

## CsvExporter

The `CsvExporter` exports the results in a CSV file.
The name of the file is _isodate_.data.csv`.

## HierarchyExporter

The `HierarchyExporter` prints the benchmark results in a nested list, together with their suites.
This way it's easier to understand the file and suite structure in which the benchmarks are wrapped.
It only prints one number, the median of the times of a benchmark.

## JsonExporter

The `JsonExporter` exports the results in a JSON file.
The name of the file is _isodate_.data.json`.

## XmlExporter

The `XmlExporter` exports the results in a XML file.
The name of the file is _isodate_.data.xml`.
