## Demo Projekt

This is a demo project, whose purpose is to demonstrate (who would've thought) how zakzak is used.

There are some benchmarks for array, object and string functionalities and a custom exporter under `custom-exporter.ts`.

To run the benchmarks you have to install the dependencies, build and then run `zakzak`.

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npx zakzak
$ # or if globally installed
$ zakzak
```
